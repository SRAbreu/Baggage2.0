## Baggage

## Description and Key Features:
Baggage is a web-based application that, in a nutshell, allows users to keep track of stuff in bags.

Baggage has a variety of uses, including:

Trip planning: Users can create bags that contain the items they wish to pack for a vacation or work trip. Users can share bags with friends to compare packing lists (who is packing the best outfit for the big Saturday night out?!) or to coordinate who is bringing the snacks for the shared AirBnB.

Valuables tracking: The app provides a simple interface for users to enter and store key information about their most prized possessions, including pictures, serial numbers, product descriptions and more. The app provides users with the flexibility to identify the information that they feel is most important to capture, and will be most important to have on hand in case of reporting theft or lost items to insurance companies.

Shopping trips: Have a few spare moments at work or while waiting for the bus? Users can use shopping bags to plan upcoming trips to the supermarket, hardware store, the mall, or anywhere else to truly maximize time running these errands (and help prevent unnecessary purchases!)

And more: Users can write their own descriptions for bags, and include any type of items that they would like. Anything that can help them stay organized.
